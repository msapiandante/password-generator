## Description

I was tasked with creating a functioning random password generator for an employer to give their employees. As technology continues to evolve and grow, more and more of people's information is at risk to identity theft. A random password generator would help the employer keep data for their company safer.I learned about arrays, functions, if and else if statements in JavaScript. I also learned how to link JavaScript to the HTML. I look forward to understanding and learning more about debugging.
